    <!-- The meta tag indicates metadata information that won't typically be visible to the viewer 
    unless they view the source code in their browser. Meta elements or tags provide descriptive information about the webpage. For example, 
    they help search engines process which information in your webpages to return in search results. -->

    <!-- The character set (charset) for UTF-8 may seem insignificant, but is crucial for establishing how computers interpret characters. 
    If the metadata for the character set is missing, that can lead to compromised security. 
    There's quite a bit of history and technical information behind the charset attribute, 
    but important takeaway from this exercise is that the VS Code boilerplate provides some sensible defaults. -->

    <!-- To apply styles to the HTML elements on the webpage, you could write the CSS code directly in the head of the webpage. 
    Writing CSS in the HTML page is called internal CSS. However, it's a best practice to separate HTML structure and CSS styling. 
    Having a separate CSS page is called external CSS. Code tends to be easier to read when it's concise and compartmentalized. 
    You can use one or more external style sheets to service multiple webpages. Rather than updating each HTML page with replicated CSS code, 
    you can make changes to a single CSS file, and have those updates applied to all of the dependent web pages. Let's link to an external stylesheet. -->

<!-- The <body> element contains the content of your website visible to your customers in their browsers.

    <h1>Task List</h1>
    <!-- An ID attribute (used in the <p> element) can be used for styling one element,

    <!-- You need a way to let your users switch between the light and dark themes in your web page. 
    In this exercise, you'll implement that functionality with an HTML <button> element. -->

    <!-- Like CSS, you could add JavaScript directly to the HTML file, but a recommended best practice is to save your JavaScript in a separate file. 
    Adding your JavaScript code to a separate file makes it easier to reuse it across several web pages  -->
    <script src="app.js"></script>
    <!-- The <script> element could be placed in the <head> or elsewhere in the <body>. 
    However, putting <script> element at the end of the <body> section enables 
    all the page content to display on the screen first, and then load the script. -->
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to view the full site.</noscript>
    <!-- a <noscript> element after the closing </script> tag can be used to show a message if JavaScript is deactivated. -->
    <!-- Adding the <noscript> element is an example of fault tolerance or graceful degradation. By using the <noscript> element, 
    your code can detect and plan for when a feature isn't supported or available -->
